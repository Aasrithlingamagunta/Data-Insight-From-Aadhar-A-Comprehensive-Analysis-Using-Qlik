# Data Insight From Aadhar *A Comprehensive Analysis Using Qlik*

## Introduction
This project explores the potential of Qlik to analyze Aadhaar data, India's unique identification system. It aims to extract valuable insights to inform policymaking, improve service delivery, and understand demographic trends.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enhance understanding by providing a deeper insight into the demographics and operational aspects of Aadhar. It aims to inform policy by offering data-driven recommendations to policymakers for better governance. Additionally, it seeks to optimize services by identifying areas where public services can be improved based on data trends. The project also promotes transparency by creating a transparent and accessible way to view and analyze Aadhar data through visualizations. Finally, it supports research by aiding researchers and analysts in understanding the impact and reach of the Aadhar system.

## Technical Architecture
The project integrates confidential Aadhar data into Qlik's platform for preprocessing, data modeling, and visualization. Qlik’s robust analytics tools enable interactive exploration and insight generation across dashboards, reports, and visualizations. Data governance and security measures are in place to maintain the authenticity and integrity of Aadhar details throughout the analysis process.

## Problem Understanding
Aadhaar Card, a 12-digit unique identification number issued by UIDAI, serves as the foundation for a universal identity infrastructure in India. This project uses Qlik Sense to conduct a thorough analysis of Aadhar data, aiming to derive actionable insights for decision-making, policy formulation, and operational efficiency within the National Identity Authority.
